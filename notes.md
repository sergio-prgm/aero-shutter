## State of the art

first mentions of such technologies are from around 2010

- from the limited data provided by governmental authorities and tech companiies
The US has the most widespread adoption of these technologies
- According to a c-roads report by the end of 2025 19 european cities will have deployed
or started their deployment of GLOSA infrastrucute. And the number is expected to grow up to
26 by 2030. It is the most popular use case in terms of implementation within the C-ROADS
- According to several projects which studied the subject both in the real world and in
test environments, the technology was found to improve efficiency and comfort

### chart

we can see here that c-roads is the most widespread amongst c-roads use cases

## App implementations

- signalguru: developed by mit and princeton. served as an early effort to show
real-world implementation of the technology. based entirely on data captured by the client (smartphone)
- Enlighten: was created in collaboration with BMW in several cities in the US.
users reported suboptimal behaviour in terms of battery efficiency and accuracy.
- Signal2X and YuBike: by yunex traffic. separate apps for different types of vehicles.
report great improvements in efficiency and (specifically yubike) speed, but there is no
data to back up those claims

### Cities

- Vigo driving app: developed in the context of the c-roads siscoga corridor as the
flagship in these types of developments
- c-the difference bordeaux: dual application aiming to offer a broad spectrum of driving aids.

## In-vehicle implementation

- PSA: developed by tts to be a general-purpose solution to be adopted by other vendors.
provides and delivers SPAT messages from traffic management systems to different platforms (adopters).
- Audi's traffic light information online (TLIO): integration of psa in their own infrastructure.
by 2019, 4700 interesections in the us were deployed. There are press statements that suggest the number has
more than doubled. The deployment has been done in europe too but data about them is sparse
claims 15% fuel consumption reduction when time-to-green (more basic technology) and glosa
- BMW's enlightn implementation: started as an integration of the app (which I previously mentioned)
within the vehicles' own infotainment systems, and evolved to a more fully capable system.
The deployment numbers aren't clearly stated.

## conclusiones

GLOSA uses V2X technology to advise drivers on optimal speeds for green lights, reducing stops and congestion while enhancing fuel efficiency.
Its adoption is hindered by communication reliability, interoperability, regulatory, and cost challenges.
Successful pilot projects by major automakers indicate promising potential for future urban mobility improvements.
